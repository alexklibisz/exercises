Based on exercises from the book Machine Learning Mastery with Python by Jason Brownlee

High-level information I found valuable in this text:

- Chapter 5: pandas summary(), hist(), and plot() functions
- Chapter 6: correlation matrices, scatter plot matrices
- Chapter 7: sklearn.preprocessing functions for preparing irregular data
