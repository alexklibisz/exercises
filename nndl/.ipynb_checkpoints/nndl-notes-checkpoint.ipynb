    "## Sigmoid Neurons\n",
    "\n",
    "Perceptrons are very sensitive to changes in their input (small input change can cause large output change), which makes it difficult to apply learning algorithms to them. Sigmoid neurons help to alleviate this because the sigmoid function has smaller changes in its output - effectively a smoothed out perceptron.\n",
    "\n",
    "The **sigmoid function**:\n",
    "\n",
    "$\\begin{eqnarray} \n",
    "  \\sigma(z) \\equiv \\frac{1}{1+e^{-z}}.\n",
    "\\tag{3}\\end{eqnarray}$\n",
    "\n",
    "The output of a sigmoid neuron with weights $w_i$, inputs $x_i$, and bias $b$:\n",
    "\n",
    "$\\begin{eqnarray} \n",
    "  \\frac{1}{1+\\exp(-\\sum_j w_j x_j-b)}.\n",
    "\\tag{4}\\end{eqnarray}$\n",
    "\n",
    "Behavior: when $w \\cdot x + b$ is large, the sigmoid output approaches 1; when it's small, the output approaches 0. The outputs are continuous values between 0 and 1, so you need some heuristic or convention to interpret meaning from them. For example, you might say that any value greater than or equal to 0.5 indicates a \"yes\", and any value less than 0.5 indicates a \"no\".\n",
    "\n",
    "## Exercises\n",
    "\n",
    "1) Suppose we take all the weights and biases in a network of perceptrons, and multiply them by a constant, $c > 0$. Show that the behavior of the network doesn't change.\n",
    "\n",
    "The perceptron's output is determined by the weighted sum of the inputs and bias compared to 0, $w \\cdot x + b > 0$. Multiplying both $w$ and $b$ by a constant $c$ gives us the inequality $cw \\cdot x + cb = c(w \\cdot x + b) > 0$. We can show they are equal:\n",
    "\n",
    "$\n",
    "cw \\cdot x + cb > 0\n",
    "\\\\ c(w \\cdot x + b) > 0\n",
    "\\\\ w \\cdot x + b > \\frac{0}{c}\n",
    "\\\\ w \\cdot x + b > 0\n",
    "$\n",
    "\n",
    "The same can be easily shown for the $\\leq 0$ inequality.\n",
    "\n",
    "2) Given a network of perceptrons and a fixed input to the network. The weights and biases are such that $w \\cdot x + b \\neq 0$ for input $x$ to any perceptron in the network. Replace all perceptrons by sigmoid neurons. Multiply the weights and biases by a positive constant $c > 0$. Show that in the limit as $c \\rightarrow \\infty$, the behavior of this network of sigmoid neurons is exactly the same as the network of perceptrons. How can this fail when $w \\cdot x + b = 0$ for one of the perceptrons?\n",
    "\n",
    "It seems I should show that as $c \\rightarrow \\infty$, $\\frac{1}{1 + e ^ {-c(w \\cdot x + b)}}$ \"behaves\" the same as $c(w \\cdot x + b)$. I'm not certain how to approach the topic of \"behavior\" at a network level - should I show that they increase at the same rate? A single case could probably be worked out using the two bit adder network above.\n",
    "\n",
    "## The Architecture of Neural Networks\n",
    "\n",
    "Terminology\n",
    "\n",
    "- Multilayer perceptrons are actually made up of sigmoid neurons (there can be other activation functions used as well).\n",
    "\n",
    "## A simple network to classify handwritten digits\n",
    "\n",
    "- Images will be 28 by 28, meaning the input layer has 27 x 27 = 784 neurons.\n",
    "- There are ten output neurons - each will have an activation value between 0 and 1. The digit gets classified by taking the neuron with the highest activation value.\n",
    "- You could also do a bit-wise output representation. This would have four neurons, each of which can represent 0 or 1. This would work because all digits from 0 to 9 can be represented with four binary bits (e.g. 0 = 0000, 4 = 0100, 9 = 1001). It turns out the 10-neuron representation performs better.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Exercise\n",
    "\n",
    "Suppose you had the 10-neuron output layer but wanted to downsample it to a 4-neuron (bit-wise) output layer. Find a set of weights that makes this possible. Assume that correct outputs in the 3rd layer (old output layer) have activation gte 0.99 and incorrect have activation < 0.01.\n",
    "\n",
    "![](http://neuralnetworksanddeeplearning.com/images/tikz13.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "We can consider this to be a linear system of equations, $Aw = B$, where $A$ is the activation values from the old output layer, $w$ is the matrix of weights we are looking for, and $B$ is the activation of the bit-wise encoded new output layer.\n",
    "\n",
    "This allows us to simply populate the matrices $A$ and $B$ and solve for the weight matrix $w$.\n",
    "\n",
    "$A$ and $B$ will look like this:\n",
    "\n",
    "$A = \\{\\{0.99, 0.001, ...\\}, \\{0.001, 0.99, 0.001, ...\\}, \\{0.001, 0.001, 0.99, 0.001, ...\\}, ... \\}$\n",
    "$B = \\{\\{0, 0, 0, 0\\}, \\{0, 0, 0, 1\\}, ...\\}$\n",
    "\n",
    "See code below for the computed solution to this sytem of equations."
