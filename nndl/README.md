# Neural Networks and Deep Learning

Exercises from http://neuralnetworksanddeeplearning.com/.
Some source code is directly copied (e.g. reading in mnist), other parts are modified for learning.

In general, I just adapted it to work in python 3 and used the keras mnist data set instead of the data set that Nielsen included in his repo.
