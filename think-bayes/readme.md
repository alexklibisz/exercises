Exercises from Allen Downey's Think Bayes version 1.09.

To make sure I internalize the concepts, I re-implement much of the `thinkbayes` module and directly use matplotlib instead of Downey's `thinkplot`. I try my best to use bare-bones Pandas, Numpy, and Scipy as much as possible (i.e. favor repetitive code over potentially ambiguous abstractions). I do use most of his code for reading data, as there's not much to change/learn there.

Certain parts of the code require [Downey's ThinkBayes2 code](https://github.com/AllenDowney/ThinkBayes2). To make this work, simply clone the ThinkBayes2 repository into this directory. The latest commit when I used the code was [17bec15](https://github.com/AllenDowney/ThinkBayes2/commit/17bec1530e8c7bac71ac2aacbd3264c4ef4bbe2e).
